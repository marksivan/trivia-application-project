#  TRIVIA APPLICATION

Created and Designed by: Irenee Niyibaho & Mark S. Tamakloe

This is a both Terminal-based and GUI-based Java trivia game application with a bank of questions in different fields that adopts our real-time adaptive questioning and recommendation system. This local app models the user experience based on real world experience. Questions dynamically adjust in difficulty based on player performance to maintain an engaging and challenging experience.

## 🧠 Game Logic

▶️ Start with medium-difficulty questions.

🔼 Answer 3 questions correctly in a row → the next question is hard 🟩 (worth more points)

🔽 Answer 3 questions incorrectly in a row → the next question is easy 🟥 (worth fewer points)

✅ After getting the first correct answer on an easy question → return to medium difficulty

🧠 Difficulty adapts in real-time to keep the game dynamic and personalized.


The game uses **min-heaps and max-heaps** to manage and prioritize questions:

- 📥 `MaxHeap.java`: Efficiently retrieves hard questions with the highest difficulty scores.
- 📤 `MinHeap.java`: Quickly accesses the easiest questions available.
- 📊 `PriorityQueue.java`: Manages underlying heap behavior to streamline dynamic transitions.
- 📋 Medium questions are selected randomly from an `ArrayList`.
